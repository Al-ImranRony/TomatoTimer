# TomatoTimer ⏲

Simple Pomodoro timer desktop app by python for using the time efficiently when working. It will start a new pomodoro cycle of 25 minits and give an alert message
to inform you when to take break. If you will not start again after a pomodoro, it will show the total pomodoro you completed when working within the whole session.

- You can use this as a desktop app by simply downloading and run the 'pyw' file in desktop as a shortcut(Python development environment required) - just Right Click on the file & create shortcut, then move to desktop. 
- You can also add icon to the shortcut to look better - just download an .ico file and change icon on properties of the file.
- I'm planning to add a todo-list API to this application.
